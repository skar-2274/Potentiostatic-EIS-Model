# Potentiostatic-EIS-Model-
Models of the impedance data obtained using the EIS in potentiostatic mode for my devices fabricated as part of my PhD project.

These scripts create a theoretical model of the impedance data from the Bode plots, the phase and the Nyquist plots. They are tailored to the fabricated probes from my devices and the associated parameters are specific to them. This allows for experimental EIS data to be validated. The mathematical formalism was based on Randles equivalent circuit.
